# Energy_Database
This project is for my brother Jacob and helping with his PhD project. The US Energy website has a zip file containing the amount of energy/water/oil/coal consumed per power plant for every calandar year. The goal of this project is to take this data, scrape it, clean it into a pandas-friendly format, then create a database that can be queried/analyzed. I started this project in early October so this is still in the beginning stages.
